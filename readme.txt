- Learning journals are often named for a specific purpose and/or formatâ€“a creative writing journal, for example. 
Even a personal blog is a kind of journal, and can thus become a learning journal if the blogging is done in order to promote, deepen, or extend learning of some kind.
-uses jinja template to dynamically build HTML pages using python concepts 
such as variables, loops, lists and so on.
